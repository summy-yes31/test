 <b>RULE 10. REPORTERS AND COMPENSATION FOR SAME</b>
 <br /> 
 <br /> 
 Preparation of any transcript on appeal by an official court reporter shall not begin until the person ordering such transcript makes a cash deposit with the reporter of such amount as the reporter reasonably estimates such transcript will cost. In the event any cash deposit exceeds the cost of the transcript ordered, the excess shall be refunded to the person who ordered the transcript upon its completion. In the event the deposit is insufficient to pay for a transcript, the remaining unpaid portion of the cost shall be due upon the delivery of the transcript to the person who ordered it prepared. Payment will be made to the reporter who prepared it.
 <br /> 
 <br /> 
 Preparations of a typewritten transcript of a record preserved by electronic recording device shall not begin until the clerk is paid a sum sufficient to cover the estimated cost of this work. The estimated charge will vary depending upon how the typewritten copy is to be prepared.
 <br /> 
 <br /> 
 If the appellant desires the circuit clerk to forward the material to the office of state courts administrator for transcribing, the estimated cost will be based on rates authorized for transcripts prepared by an official court reporter. If the appellant desires to make arrangements for his own typist to prepare the transcript, the deposit required will be based on the estimated cost of having clerk personnel supervise the copying of the tape which was used to electronically record the proceedings. It is the responsibility of the appellant to pay this amount upon being presented with a bill by the circuit clerk. (See Rules

 <a name="1This%20section%20notes%20the%20type%20of%20f"></a>
 <b><sup>1</sup></b>
 This section notes the type of filing system adopted by the circuit and delineates where cases should be filed. If the circuit has adopted a centralized filing system, then this should be stated in the local rules with a notation that sets forth where cases should be filed. Also, there should be a specific reference under each heading stating where cases should be filed that will be handled in the associate division, in the probate division, etc.
 <br /> 
 <br /> 
 Similarly, if the circuit has maintained a decentralized filing system, the location for filing each type of case should be noted under the appropriate heading. Again, there should be a specific reference to the associate division under each heading. Finally, it should be noted that the better practice is to detail the location of filing rather than simply referring to where cases were filed before the implementation of the new judicial article.
 <br /> 
 <br /> 
 <a name="2A%20circuit%20court%2C%20if%20it%20so%20desire"></a>
 <b><sup>2</sup></b>
 A circuit court, if it so desires, may provide that cases which would be heard and determined by a circuit judge that are automatically assigned to an associate circuit judge by local court rule should be filed with the divisional clerk of the appropriate division presided over by the associate circuit judge. However, the mechanics of recording and reporting these types of cases under these circumstances may present problems with 
 <a href="/courts/ClerkHandbooksP2RulesOnly.nsf/e2aa3309ef5c449186256be20060c329/816d943cdf650aa986256c24006e6b6f?OpenDocument">Administrative Rule 4</a>
 . Consequently, the circuit may decide to only have those cases which an associate circuit judge can hear and determine without assignment as provided for in subsection 2 of Section 478.225, RSMo
  1978, filed with the division clerk and have the circuit clerk forward those files to an associate circuit judge in other instances.
 <br /> 
 <br /> 
 <a name="3%20Another%20alternative%20is%20to%20provi"></a>
 <b><sup>3</sup></b>
  Another alternative is to provide that the case &quot;shall be filed at the central filing desk for the associate circuit judges on the (state location).&quot;
 <br /> 
 <br /> 
 <a name="4%20These%20fees%20are%20required%20to%20be%20p"></a>
 <b><sup>4</sup></b>
  These fees are required to be paid into the court upon the filing of an action. They are distinguished from court costs.
 <br /> 
 <br /> 
 <a name="5%20The%20Presiding%20Judges'%20Committee"></a>
 <b><sup>5 </sup></b>
 The Presiding Judges' Committee, in consultation with other presiding judges at the June 10, 1980 meeting of the presiding judge in Kansas City, discussed the value to practicing lawyers of having a uniform filing fee in every circuit throughout the state which would assure the commencement of the action and the issuance of summons. If such a uniform filing fee were to be mandated, individual circuits could always require an additional deposit before further proceedings would take place, if desired. However, the uniformity would assure that no statute of limitations would expire because of the inadequacy of a fee mailed to a clerk.
 <br /> 
 <br /> 
 <a name="6%20Generally%2C%20costs%20represent%20an%20a"></a>
 <b><sup>6 </sup></b>
 Generally, costs represent an assessment by the court in return for a party's use of court services and therefore will differ from case to case and party to party, based upon the use made of the court's services.
 <br /> 
 <br /> 
 <a name="7This%20section%20is%20designed%20to%20info"></a>
 <b><sup>7</sup></b>
 This section is designed to inform the reader of those cases which will be heard by the associate circuit judge regardless of where the cases will be filed. The structure of this section should work regardless of whether the circuit has a centralized or decentralized filing system. See Rule 4. Part 3 of the proposed rule can be lengthened or shortened depending upon the type of &quot;circuit court&quot; cases to be heard by associate circuit judges.
 <br /> 
 <br /> 
 <a name="8%20If%20the%20circuit%20wishes%20to%20incorp"></a>
 <b><sup>8</sup></b>
  If the circuit wishes to incorporate the authority given the presiding judge under 
 Section 
 <a href="http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/47800002401.html">478.240</a>
  into the local court rules, &sect; 
 <a href="http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/47800002401.html">478.240</a>
 , RSMo
  1978 should be copied here. However, because of a desire to avoid duplicity no model rule was drafted. Also, a rule requiring that a method for recording the proceeding must be established prior to a special assignment is found in some circuits. This is covered by &sect; 
 <a href="http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/47800000721.html">478.072</a>
 , RSMo
  1978 which provides that &quot;the method of preserving the record in each such assigned case (to the associate circuit judge to be heard on the record) shall be specified by the assigning judge at the time his order of assignment is entered.&quot;
 <br /> 
 <br /> 
 <a name="9%20Sections%20517.0202(2)(3)(4)%2C%20517"></a>
 <b><sup>9</sup></b>
  
 Sections 517.0202(2)(3)(4), 517.240, 517.330, 517.340, and 517.063, RSMo
  1978 delineate when a case must be certified to the circuit division from the associate division. If a circuit chooses to duplicate these statutes this section would be the appropriate place to include a rule to that effect. However, the committee has determined that no rule is required. If this rule is designed to limit the presiding judges assignment of cases to an associate circuit judge, it should be so stated.
 <br /> 
 <br /> 
 <a name="10%20Sections%20512.180%20to%20512.320%2C%20R"></a>

 Sections 
 <a href="http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/51200001801.html">512.180</a>
  to 
 <a href="http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/51200003201.html">512.320</a>
 , RSMo
  1978 generally discuss the right to trial de novo.
  Sections 543.290 and 548.330, RSMo
  1978 also discuss the right to trial de novo in misdemeanor and infraction cases. Unless the circuit wishes to adopt a local rule duplicating these statutes, no rule should be included within this section. However, it should be noted that a circuit cannot abolish the &quot;right&quot; to trial de novo by providing that all cases will be heard on the record, that all cases will be appealed to the appropriate appellate court, or that all cases filed in the associate division are specially assigned to the associate judges for a hearing on the record.
 <br /> 
 <br /> 
 <a name="11%20If%20the%20circuit%20wishes%20to%20delin"></a>
 <b><sup>11</sup></b>
  If the circuit wishes to delineate the system established for court personnel to check out files, then it should be explained at this point.
 <br /> 
 <br /> 
 <a name="12%20This%20section%20should%20inform%20the"></a>
 <b><sup>12</sup></b>
  This section should inform the reader of the type of case that is subject to being placed on the dismissal docket. As written, the model rule is designed to cover all cases pending in the circuit court. However, if a circuit chooses to only consider for inactivity dismissal of those cases pending in the circuit division the rule could read as follows: &quot;The clerk shall each six months, on or about June 1 and December 1 of each year, prepare a dismissal docket of all civil cases pending in the circuit division in which no activity has been noted on the docket sheet for (Specify time).&quot;
 <br /> 
 <br /> 
 <a name="13%20If%20there%20is%20more%20than%20one%20cour"></a>
 <b><sup>13</sup></b>
  If there is more than one courtroom, indicate to which courtroom the attorney is to report.
 <br /> 
 <br /> 
 <a name="14%20Indicate%20whether%20hearings%20wil"></a>
  
 <b><sup>14</sup></b>
  Indicate whether hearings will be in chambers or in open court.
 <br /> 
 <br /> 
 <a name="15%20If%20there%20is%20specific%20designati"></a>
 <b><sup>15 </sup></b>
 If there is specific designation for where the parties should sit, specify this fact at this point. Also, mention who is permitted to sit at the counsel table.
 <br /> 
 <br /> 

 <br /> 
 <a name="17%20Under%20this%20section%2C%20the%20circui"></a>
 <b><sup>17</sup></b>
  Under this section, the circuit may want to consider drafting a rule which states that an attorney or party who sends a written communication to the court is responsible for sending a copy to the opposing counsel. However, no rule was proposed on this topic because of the lack of uniformity in the circuits.
 <br /> 
 <br /> 
 <a name="18%20Any%20time%20limitation%20establishe"></a>
 <b><sup>18 </sup></b>
 Any time limitation established for criminal discovery should be stated in this section. (See also, 
 <a href="#RULE%2032.%20DISCOVERY">Rule 32</a>
 ).
 <br /> 
 <br /> 
 <a name="19%20The%20cross-reference%20to"></a>
 <b><sup>19</sup></b>
  The cross-reference to 
 <a href="#Rule%2033.%20Pretrial%20Motions">Rule 33</a>
  should be adequate unless the circuit establishes specific time limitations for criminal motions that it does not have for civil motions. If there are time limitations peculiar to criminal cases, these should be set out under Rule 33 and this section. For example, if all motions in criminal cases must be filed within ten days after arraignment, this time limitation should be discussed under 
 <a href="#Rule%2033.%20Pretrial%20Motions">Rule 33 </a>
 and 
 <a href="#67.7%20MOTIONS">Rule 67.7</a>
 .
 <br /> 
 <br /> 
 <a name="20%20Some%20circuits%20specify%20in%20great"></a>
 <b><sup>20</sup></b>
  Some circuits specify in great detail the requirements for a dissolution decree. If the circuit desires such a rule, it should be set forth under this section. 
 <ul> 
  <ul></ul> 
 </ul> 
 <a name="21Section%20514.470%2C%20RSMo%201978%20prov"></a>
 <b><sup>21</sup></b>
 Section 514.470, RSMo
  1978 provides that by rule of court a law library fee may be required. Consequently, any local provision requiring the payment of the fee should be contained in the local rule. But, the committee thought this &quot;cost&quot; should be set forth under Rule 100 rather than Rule 5 because other costs were not listed under Rule 5.
